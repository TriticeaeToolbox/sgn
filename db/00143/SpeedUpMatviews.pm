=head1 SYNOPSIS

mx-run SpeedUpMatviews [options] -H hostname -D dbname -u username [-F]

this is a subclass of L<CXGN::Metadata::Dbpatch>
see the perldoc of parent class for more details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This patch:
 - updates the materialized_phenoview and materialized_genoview to reduce indexing and speed up their underlying queries
 - rebuilds single category and binary materialized views as just views
 - updates trials view to exclude genotyping project folders
 - drops deprecated refresh functions and removes single category and binary views from matviews tracking table

has '+description' => ( default => <<'' );
This patch updates the materialized_phenoview and materialized_genoview to speed up their underlying queries (prevents joining through nd_experiment, drops indexes). Also redefines trials view to exclude genotyping trial folders
