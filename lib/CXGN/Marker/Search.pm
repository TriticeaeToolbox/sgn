=head1 NAME

CXGN::Marker::Search - object to return lists of markers based on your criteria

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CXGN::Marker::Search;
  my $search = CXGN::Marker::Search->new();

  #add criteria here, for example..
  $search->on_chromosome('5');

  $search->perform_search(1,30);
  my @marker_objects = $search->fetch_full_objects();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Running a search consists of three steps:

0. Create marker search object

1. Specify search criteria, as many as you like

2. Call perform_search() to execute the SQL

3. Retrieve search results with one of the fetch_* functions. These can return a list of marker_id's, a list of location_id's, or a list of full-fledged marker objects.

As an alternative to (2) and (3), you may instead want to perform the query yourself (say if you want to use it as a subquery in a larger SQL statement your program is writing). In this case, the function return_subquery_with_placeholders() will do what you require; steps (2) and (3) are not necessary.

# here are the search criteria thingies!

=head2 Search Criteria Methods

These methods can be called in any order. The search object
"remembers" what criteria you have asked for, and when you perform
the search, all of them are applied. As you are building the query,
you can call query_text() if you would like to see the SQL string, say for
debugging.

None of these methods have interesting return values.

=over 12

=item random()

Causes the query to return only a single marker, randomly selected
from those that fit the other criteria you provide. 

  $msearch->random();
  $msearch->perform_search();
  my ($random_marker) = $msearch->fetch_id_list();
  # returns a random random marker

  # OR

  $msearch->on_chromosome(5);
  $msearch->random();
  $msearch->in_collection('KFG');
  $msearch->perform_search();
  my ($random_marker) = $msearch->fetch_id_list();
  # randomly selects one of the KFG markers on chr 5.

=cut

sub random {

  my ($self) = @_;

  # really, we just have to special-case this. 
  $self->{random} = 1;

}


=item name_like($string) 

Limits the markers to those with a name like the one given. 
There is no need to run clean_marker_name; this function will
search for the name both cleaned and as originally input. 

The query is run with ILIKE. Asterisks are converted to percent
characters. If you know the marker name, please see name_exactly().

$msearch->name_like('TG*');

=cut

sub name_like {
  
  my ($self, $name) = @_;

  # convert * to % (but leave underscores alone)

  $name =~ s|[^-_\w./%]||g;

  # clean the name to see what WE would call it. 
  # We'll search for both the input name and the cleaned name.
  my $clean_name = clean_marker_name($name);

  # also allow to search on marker SGN-M type identifiers in the name 
  # field. exact/starts with etc won't be supported for SGN-M ids.
  # (Lukas 4/2008).

}


=item name_in($names)

Limits the search to markers that have one of the EXACT names specified.
See also name_exactly() and name_like().

  my @names = ('marker1', 'marker2');

Limits the search to one particular marker that you know the id of. 
Can be useful when looking for many locations of one marker.

# more criteria thingies, but these have to do with map locations

=item must_be_mapped()

Limits the marker results to only markers that are mapped. 

You do not need to call this method if you are ALSO asking for a
particular chromosome, map, species, etc. Those methods will automatically
exclude unmapped markers.

  $msearch->must_be_mapped();

}

=item on_chr(@chrs)

Limits the marker results to only markers on a given chromosome or
linkage group. 

   $msearch->on_chr(5, 6, 7);

Bonus feature: if you search for (say) chromosome 4, the search will
automagically include linkage groups 4a and 4b in addition to 4.

}

=item position_between($start, $end)

Limits the results to markers appearing between the given endpoints.

  $msearch->position_between(90,100);
  $msearch->on_chr(5);
  # returns only markers between 90-100 on chr 5

  $msearch->position_between(50, undef);

=item has_subscript()

Not very useful, except in testing. 
Limits the results to marker locations that have subscripts.
Remember that most markers do NOT have subscripts.

  $msearch->has_subscript();

=cut

sub has_subscript {

  my ($self) = @_;

  $self->_add_loc_query("SELECT $self->{m2mfields} FROM marker_to_map as m2m WHERE subscript IS NOT NULL");

}

=item confidence_at_least($conf)

Limits results to marker locations with a given confidence or greater. 
Remember that many maps have entirely uncalculated confidences, so this 
is not always appropriate. 

The only argument this method takes is the minimum confidence. This
can be supplied as a confidence_id OR as a confidence name. Using the
ID will result in a slightly more efficient query.

   $msearch->confidence_at_least(2);
   $msearch->confidence_at_least('F(LOD3)');

}

=item with_bac_associations(@clone_ids)

Limit results to markers that have some sort of bac associations.
This is equivalent to running with_overgo_associations,
with_manual_associations, and with_computational_associations. As with
all three of those, the list of clone_id's is optional. If no
clone_id's are specified, the results will include all markers that
have any bacs at all.

Returns a string for debugging purposes. This string contains the query and indicates the placeholder values. If perform_search() has already been called, this is the query that was run. If perform_search() has NOT yet been called, this is the query as it currently appears at this stage in the query-building process. It is preceded by the tag "[PROVISIONAL]".

=item return_subquery_and_placeholders()

Instead of performing the search through this module, you may wish to
use the query we construct, perhaps as a subquery in some SQL you are
writing. This method returns the query as a string, and a reference to
an array of the required placeholders.

    my ($subquery, $places) =

Performs the search; this is like the execute() function in DBI. After
calling perform_search(), you will be ready to use the fetch_* methods (see below).

If you only want a subset of results, say the first 30, specify the start and end.

  $msearch->perform_search();

   my @loc_objs = $msearch->fetch_location_markers();

WARNING: If your search could return more than a few dozen locations, the process of creating all these objects may take a VERY LONG TIME. This is not recommended in such cases; try one of the other fetch_* methods instead.

=head1 DEVELOPING SEARCH PIECES

Fortunately, new search criteria methods are pretty easy to write and
test. This module works by intersecting subqueries with each other, so
each search criterion simply adds a subquery. When you call
perform_search(), the subqueries are glued together into one big query,
and the placeholders are all merged into one list. This creates a
mega-query that the database can easily optimize as it pleases. In
practice, I find the resulting queries to be very fast.

So, let's say you want to add a new method, something along the lines
of $msearch->name_like($some_input_name). Here is how to develop that
subquery and how to integrate it with the search module.

There are two different types of subqueries that this module expects: 

(a) queries that relate to a marker by itself, and begin "SELECT
marker_id FROM..."

(b) queries that relate to a marker in a map location, and include the view called marker_to_map. These begin "SELECT $self->{m2mfields} FROM marker_to_map as m2m..." . So long as you include the marker_to_map view, you don't have to worry about what is in $self->{m2mfields}. 

Let's walk through an easy type (a) example. Say you want to write the name_exactly function: it selects markers whose name is exactly what the user inputs. First, sit down at your psql prompt and write an SQL query that selects the markers you want out of the whole entire database:

  SELECT marker_id FROM marker_alias WHERE alias = ?

That\'s your query, and there is one placeholder, for the marker name. Your subroutine will simply specify the subquery and the placeholders, and use the _add_marker_query() function to add itself to the growing query. This is the entire function:

  sub name_exactly {
    my ($self, $name) = @_;

    my $subquery = "SELECT marker_id FROM marker_alias WHERE alias = ?";

    $self->_add_marker_query($subquery, $name);

  }

_add_marker_query() takes a subquery and a list of placeholders, so if
you have many placeholders, just supply them one after the other (or
with an array):

  $self->_add_marker_query($subquery, $one, $two, $red, $blue);
  $self->_add_marker_query($subquery, @crapload_of_placeholders);


Pretty easy, huh? Let\'s try a type (b) example, where we have to join
through the marker_to_map table. The only difference is that you call _add_loc_query instead of _add_marker_query. 

  sub on_chr {
    my ($self, $chr) = @_;

    # asking for "4" should also retrieve "4b".
    if ($chr =~ /^\D+$/){ $chr .='[ABCabc]?' }

    my $q = "SELECT $self->{m2mfields} FROM marker_to_map as m2m WHERE lg_name ~ ? ";
  
    $self->_add_loc_query($q, $chr);

  }

That is all! Let\'s review: 

1. Write your query, at the psql prompt or otherwise

2. Rephrase in terms of placeholders

3. Stick it in a subroutine inside this module, using _add_marker_query() or _add_loc_query()

4. Test and document your subroutine.

5. The end! You don\'t have to understand or modify any of the other existing code. 

Where in the file should you put your new code? Well, all the type
(a)\'s are together, and all the type (b)\'s are together. It\'s like the
high school cafeteria: find your friends, and sit with them.

As you test the subroutine, if you don\'t get results you expect,
simply print query_text() and you will see the query as you have built
it, and the list of placeholders that go along with it (in order). You
can actually cut-and-paste this into your psql monitor if you like,
for debugging purposes. After debugging, you may still find it useful
to use query_text() in die statements, warnings, or even as a comment
in the html of your search-related page.
