=head1 NAME

CXGN::Stock::Seedlot::Maintenance - a class to manage Seedlot Maintenance Events

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store and retrieve maintenance actions and/or observations performed 
for the proper maintenance of a particular Seedlot.

Seedlot maintenance events are stored as JSON stock props, where each maintanence event 
has an associated cvterm_id of a cvterm from a 'seedlot maintenance' ontology.  This 
ontology defines that types of maintenance events that can be associated with a Seedlot.

=head1 USAGE

Seedlot Maintenance Events are associated directly with existing Seedlots and are linked to 
cvterms (by cvterm_id) of terms in a loaded seedlot maintenance event ontology.  The root of 
this ontology must be specified in the sgn_local.conf using the `seedlot_maintenance_event_ontology_root`
term.

The CXGN::Stock::Seedlot Class has helper functions for storing and retrieving Seedlot Maintenance Events.
