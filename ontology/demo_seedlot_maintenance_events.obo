remark: This ontology is an example of a simple seedlot maintenance event ontology.  The ontology should include three levels in the hierarchy (below the root term): the top level are categories to group the events (example: into actions and observations), the second level includes the actual event terms, and the third (optional) level includes allowed values for the event (if there are no child terms for the event, the event will allow free-form entry for the value).
