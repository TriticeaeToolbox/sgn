Readings from the instrument are not absolute chlorophyll values, instead each reading is a ?chlorophyll concentration index? (CCI, ranging from 0 to 99.9). Measurements are typically made on the flag leaf (once fully expanded), although measurements of lower leaves may be taken to assess canopy chlorophyll profiles." []

Readings from the instrument are not absolute chlorophyll values, instead each reading is a ?chlorophyll concentration index? (CCI, ranging from 0 to 99.9).
